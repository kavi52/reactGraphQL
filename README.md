# reactGraphQL
This is a demo beginner project for graphQL with react.
Using Node on the back-end to create a GraphQL server, and React on the front-end to query the server.

MongoDB (using mLab)
Apollo (glue layer for react and graphQL)

It doesn't really matter which database we really use.. you can use mongoDB, sql and mixture of both.
